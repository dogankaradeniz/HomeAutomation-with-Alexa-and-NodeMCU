* Home Automation with Alexa and NodeMCU
* WeMos smart devices emulation using FAUXMOESP Library
*
* Code based on the great open source lib & example code at: 
* http://tinkerman.cat/emulate-wemo-device-esp8266/
* which is based off of the Python example code by: 
* https://github.com/makermusings/fauxmo

* 
* fauxmoESP is a library for ESP8266-based devices that emulates a Belkin WeMo device 
* and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from 
* Alexa-powered devices like the Amazon Echo or the Dot.
*  
* 7 devices to be discovered:
*  
*  4 Simple WeMo devices
*   ==> Light1    ==> Relay 1 ==> NodeMCU D5
*   ==> Light2    ==> Relay 3 ==> NodeMCU D7
*   ==> Outlet1   ==> Relay 2 ==> NodeMCU D6 
*   ==> Outlet2   ==> Relay 4 ==> NodeMCU D8
*  
*  3 Groups of devices
*   ==> All Devices 
*   ==> Living Room (Light1 and Outlet1)
*   ==> Bed Room (Light2 and Outlet2)
*   
*  To discovery devices for the first time, use voice commnad: 
*  "Computer (or Alexa), discovery devices"
*  
*  To activate a device or a gropu of devices, you should use voice commands, like: 
*  "Computer (or Alexa), turn on Light1" or "..., turn off Light1"
*  "Computer (or Alexa), turn on Living Room" or "..., turn off Living Room"
*  "Computer (or Alexa), turn on All Devices" or "..., turn off All Devices"
